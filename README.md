## OmniAuth-Credport

This gem contains credport strategy for OmniAuth. You can use this gem with
omniauth to easily integrate Credport's trust product. Checkout more on [Creport.org](https://www.credport.org). It uses by default [https://www.credport.org](https://www.credport.org) as the server, but you can use the ENV var CREDPORT_BASE_URL to point it to [https://credport-staging.herokuapp.com](https://credport-staging.herokuapp.com), our staging/test server.
